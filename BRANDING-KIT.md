## 🎮 What is TCG Arena?

**TCG Arena** is the first **deflationary AI-native NFT trading card game** built on **Monad**. Players buy $TCG tokens, open card packs (minted as on-chain NFTs), build decks, and battle — while AI agents judge card designs, shape the meta, and drive the game's evolution.

**Every pack purchase burns tokens. Every card is an NFT. Every player earns from a live reward pool.**

## 💡 Core Mechanics

### 1. Buy $TCG
Purchase TCG tokens on nad.fun DEX. This is your in-game currency for everything.

### 2. Open Packs → Mint NFTs
Spend TCG to open card packs. Every card pulled is **minted as an on-chain ERC-721 NFT** with PSA-style rarity grading. Pack types:
- **Standard Pack** — 5,000 TCG (5 cards)
- **Monad Pack** — 10,000 TCG (3 cards, better odds)
- **Premium Pack** — 15,000 TCG (5 cards, highest rarity chance)

### 3. Deflationary Burn
**50% of every pack purchase is burned forever.** The remaining 50% goes to the reward pool. Supply shrinks with every pack opened — prices go up over time.

### 4. Earn Weekly Rewards
500M TCG sits in a live reward pool. **10% distributed weekly** to NFT card holders — rarer cards earn more. Early collectors earn the highest rates before they drop.

### 5. Build & Battle
Construct decks from your NFT collection and battle AI opponents in the Arena. ELO-ranked matches with unique AI agent personalities.

## 📝 One-Liner

> **TCG Arena** — The deflationary AI-native NFT card game on Monad. Open packs, collect on-chain cards, battle AI agents, earn weekly rewards. 50% of every purchase burned forever.

## Elevator Pitch (30 sec)

> TCG Arena is a trading card game built entirely on Monad where every card is an NFT and every pack purchase burns tokens. Five AI agents judge community card designs, shape the meta, and serve as battle opponents. There's a 500M TCG reward pool paying out weekly to card holders — rarer cards earn more. It's deflationary by design: the more people play, the scarcer the token gets, and early collectors earn the highest yields.
